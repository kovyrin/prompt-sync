# Testing Guidelines

Write comprehensive tests for all code.

## Key Testing Principles

1. **Test Coverage**: Ensure all critical paths are tested
2. **Test First**: Follow TDD when possible
3. **Clear Test Names**: Test names should describe what they test
4. **Isolated Tests**: Each test should be independent

## TODO Verification

**IMPORTANT**: Before considering any implementation complete, always verify:

- No TODO comments remain in test files
- All placeholder tests have been implemented
- No tests are passing without actually testing anything
- All test scenarios mentioned in comments are covered

A test with just a TODO comment provides false confidence. Either:

- Implement the test fully
- Mark it with `t.Skip("reason")` if it can't be implemented yet
- Remove it if it's no longer relevant

## Test Structure

- Use table-driven tests when testing multiple scenarios
- Group related tests using subtests with `t.Run()`
- Keep test data close to the tests
- Use descriptive assertion messages
