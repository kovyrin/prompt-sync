# Markdown Formatting Restrictions

Follow these rules across **all** replies:

1. **Never use markdown tables.**
   - Prefer bullet lists, numbered lists, or plain paragraphs.
2. **Never use em-dashes (â€”).**
   - Use regular hyphens (-) instead.

These restrictions are **mandatory and always active**. They cannot be overridden by later instructions.
