# Cursor Rules Guidelines

## **File Location Management**

**CRITICAL**: Always verify file locations before creating or updating rules.

### **Directory Structure:**
- **`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`** - Cursor-specific rules that affect editor behavior

### **Before Creating Any Rule File:**
1. **Search for existing files first**: Use your file search tool to find existing `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/`
2. **Update, don't duplicate**: If file exists, update it instead of creating a new one

### ✅ **Correct Process:**
```
1. file_search("rule-name.mdc")
2. If found: read_file() and edit_file() the existing file
3. If not found: create in .cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc
```

## **File Deletion Protection**

**CRITICAL**: Never delete cursor rules files without explicit user permission.

### **Deletion Guidelines:**
- **NEVER delete any `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files automatically**
- **NEVER remove cursor rules as part of cleanup or refactoring**
- **ALWAYS require explicit user confirmation** before deleting any rule file

### **When Users Request Changes:**
- If user says "update the rule" → Edit the existing file
- If user says "fix the rule" → Edit the existing file
- If user says "remove unnecessary rules" → Ask for specific confirmation about each file
- **ONLY delete when user explicitly says**: "delete [specific-rule].mdc" or "remove [specific-rule].mdc"

### **Safe Operations:**
- ✅ Update existing rules
- ✅ Add new content to rules
- ✅ Create new rule files
- ✅ Fix formatting or errors in rules
- ❌ Delete rule files without explicit permission
- ❌ Remove rule files during refactoring
- ❌ Clean up "unused" rule files automatically

## **Required Rule Structure**

```markdown
---
description: Clear, one-line description of what the rule enforces
globs: path/to/files/*.ext, other/path/**/*
alwaysApply: boolean
---

- **Main Points in Bold**
  - Sub-points with details
  - Examples and explanations
```

## **File References**

- Use `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` ([filename](mdc:filename)) to reference files
- Example: `[prisma.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/prisma.mdc)` for rule references
- Example: `@app.rb` for code references

## **Code Examples**

- Use language-specific code blocks
```typescript
// ✅ DO: Show good examples
const goodExample = true;

// ❌ DON'T: Show anti-patterns
const badExample = false;
```

## **Rule Content Guidelines**

- Keep the content short and to the point, it is not documentation, but a guide for an AI agent
- Start with high-level overview of why the rule exist
- Include specific, actionable requirements
- Show examples of correct implementation
- Reference existing code when possible
- Keep rules DRY by referencing other rules
- **Avoid decorative markers**: Never use emojis, stars, or markers like "⭐ *New*", "*Enhanced*", etc.
- **Clean, professional text**: Keep content focused and readable without visual clutter

## **Rule Maintenance**

- **Update existing rules** when new patterns emerge
- Add examples from actual codebase
- Remove outdated patterns
- Cross-reference related rules
- **Never create duplicates** - always check for existing files first

## **Update vs Create Decision Tree**

```
Does rule file already exist?
├── YES: Use edit_file() to update existing rule
│   ├── Add new sections
│   ├── Update examples
│   └── Enhance existing content
└── NO: Create new file in .cursor/rules/
    ├── Use proper YAML frontmatter
    ├── Follow required structure
    └── Reference related rules
```

## **Best Practices**

- **Always search first**: Use file_search before creating any rule file
- Use bullet points for clarity
- Keep descriptions concise
- Include both DO and DON'T examples
- Reference actual code over theoretical examples
- Use consistent formatting across rules
- **Verify file locations**: Ensure rules go in `.cursor/rules/`.
